Finding target   is the task of identifying an already detected object as a known or unknown target. I use Opencv library which using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. We can define it as the ability to see and perceive the world comes naturally to us humans. Itâ€™s second nature for us to gather information from our surroundings through the gift of vision and perception and uses your laptop camera to capture the video as it is on live camera and with the help of GaussianBlur technique which will do smoothening the image. This program also uses threshold, findcontours, dilate etc... for the better accuracy.
